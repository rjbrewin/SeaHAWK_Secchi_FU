# SeaHAWK_Secchi_FU

This GitHub repository show an example of how to compute the Secchi depth and Forel Ule colour using Level 2 (NASA processed) SeaHAWK imagery. It contains a Jupyter notebook showing an example of processing a SeaHawk image and estimating Secchi depth and the Forel Ule colour, using standard algroithms of Lee et al. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.002) and  Pitarch et al. (2019) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111249).

Code was developed by Leon Ćatipović and modified by Bob Brewin.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image below. Do note it does take a while for the processing to complete.
